# BookSearch

This is a refactored application that uses React in the front end and MongoDB/ GraphQL in the back end.
On the front end, We allow end users to search for any book(s) using Google's REST APIs for books. An authenticated user is able to save books to his/her profile.

Users have the ability to sign up on this site, This creates a user account in the database as well as login using those credentials in future. Passwords are hashed and data is stored in the collections within MongoDB.

All the crud operations to add a book, delete a book, fetch a user's account etc are done with graphQl Queries and Mutations.
